    "paragraph1": "Hello! I'm Flavia, specializing in hair coloring—especially blondes, balayage, and ombré. Since 2006, I've been deeply involved in the beauty industry, and since 2017, I've been working at iFierce Beauty Lounge.",
    "paragraph2": "My passion for hair transformation started early when I used to color my mom’s hair. That led me to invest in courses, training, and hands-on experience at various salons until I finally earned my own chair. Today, I see every client as an opportunity to enhance the confidence they already carry within.",
    "paragraph3": "My specialty is creating modern and healthy looks while preserving hair integrity. I also love getting to know each client and building long-lasting relationships. For me, hair is not just color—it’s expression, connection, and genuine care.",
    "paragraph4": "Every day, I learn from my team and the unique challenges that come through the salon doors. If you're looking to lighten your hair or completely transform your look, I'm here to help.",
